## Family 5 of analysis : multivariate analysis {#family-5}

Multivariate analysis can answer to multiple objective.
One of them can be to study diversity structure and identify parents to cross based on either good complementarity or similarity for some traits 

### Decision tree


To study diversity structure and identify parents to cross based on either good complementarity or similarity for some traits, different scenario are possible (Figure \@ref(fig:decision-tree-Study-diversity-structure-and-identify-complementary-or-similar-parents-for-cross)).
It can be completed by analysis of molecular data and genetic distance trees (**M3**, section \@ref(molecular)).


```{r decision-tree-Study-diversity-structure-and-identify-complementary-or-similar-parents-for-cross, out.width='100%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Decision tree with experimental constraints, designs and methods of agronomic analysis carry out in `PPBstats` regarding the objective :Study diversity structure and identify parents to cross based on either good complementarity or similarity for some traits. **D** refers to designs and **M** to methods."}

### Workflow and function relations in `PPBstats` regarding family 2 of analysis

Figure \@ref(fig:main-workflow-family-5) displays the functions and their relationships.
Table \@ref(tab:function-descriptions-workflow-family-5) describes each of the main functions.

You can have more information for each function by typing `?function_name` in your R session.

```{r main-workflow-family-5, out.width='20%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Main functions used in the workflow of family 5."}
